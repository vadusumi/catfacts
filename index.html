			<li>Unlike dogs, cats do not have a sweet tooth. Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.</li>
			<li>When a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.</li>
			<li>A group of cats is called a clowder.</li>
			<li>A cat can’t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat’s paw points the same way. To get down from a tree, a cat must back down.</li>
			<li>Cats make about 100 different sounds. Dogs make only about 10.</li>
